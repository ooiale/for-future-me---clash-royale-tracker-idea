# for-future-me---clash-royale-tracker-idea

hi I had this idea of making a tracker to help with clash royaul matches.
the idea was to select the opponent's cards so I never forget their deck.
However, it was quite distracting having to find on the screen, then click on the icons to select
the opponent's cards.

Ideas:
- use audio to select the opponent's deck
- maybe use audio to count the opponent's cycle? (problem - champion 3 card cycle.)
- if I can count opponent's cycle then its easy to also count their elixir lol
